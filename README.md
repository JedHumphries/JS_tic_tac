to think like a programmer you have to break down the problems plan make steps break it down more before even coding.

also keep coding when you can. It gets harder to remember even the basics after a few months not doing it.

and...ALWAYS PLAN AND BREAK IT DOWN INTO PARTS. it makes it so much easier.
